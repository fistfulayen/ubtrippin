description: Manages travel for your user via UBTRIPPIN — trips, items, loyalty programs, family, city guides, notifications, and more. Use when the user asks about their trips, upcoming travel, flights, hotels, train bookings, loyalty numbers, family travel, or wants to manage their travel tracker. Requires a UBTRIPPIN API key from ubtrippin.xyz/settings.

# UBTRIPPIN Skill

**UBTRIPPIN** is a personal travel tracker that parses booking confirmation emails and organises them into trips. As an agent, you can read and manage a user's trips, items, loyalty vault, family groups, city guides, and more via REST API.

---

## Setup (First Time)

1. Ask your user to visit **ubtrippin.xyz/settings** and generate an API key.
2. The key looks like: `ubt_k1_<40 hex chars>`. Store it securely.
3. Ask for their **registered sender email** — the email address they use to forward bookings (typically their personal inbox). This is their "allowed sender" in UBTRIPPIN.
4. You'll need both to operate: the API key for reads/writes, the email address for adding new bookings via forwarding.

---

## Authentication

All API calls use a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer ubt_k1_<your_key>
```

Base URL: `https://www.ubtrippin.xyz`

**Rate limit:** 100 requests/minute per API key. HTTP 429 if exceeded — back off 60 seconds.

## Adding New Bookings (Email Forwarding)

The primary way to add bookings is **email forwarding**. When your user receives a booking confirmation:

1. Forward the email to: **trips@ubtrippin.xyz**
2. **Must forward from their registered sender address** — UBTRIPPIN rejects unknown senders.
3. UBTRIPPIN's AI parser extracts the booking details automatically (usually within 30 seconds).
4. The item appears in the relevant trip (or a new trip is created).

**How to do this as an agent:**
- Use your email sending capability to forward the email from the user's address to trips@ubtrippin.xyz.
- Or instruct the user to do it manually from their inbox.
- PDF attachments (e.g. eTickets) are supported — include them in the forward.

**Works with:** flights, hotels, trains (Eurostar, SNCF, Thalys, etc.), rental cars, ferry bookings, and most major booking platforms (Booking.com, Expedia, Kayak, Trainline, etc.).

## Error Handling

| Status | Code | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| 401 | `unauthorized` | Missing/invalid API key |
| 400 | `invalid_param` | Bad UUID or missing field |
| 404 | `not_found` | Trip/item not found or belongs to another user |
| 429 | _(body varies)_ | Rate limited — wait 60s |
| 500 | `internal_error` | Server error — retry once |

All errors return: `{ "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." } }`

---

## Notes for Agents

- All IDs are UUIDs.
- Dates are ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DD` for dates, `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` for timestamps).
- `details_json` contains raw parsed data — useful for confirmation numbers, seat assignments, loyalty numbers, etc.
- `confidence` (0–1): how confident the AI parser was. Items with `needs_review: true` may have errors.
- The API key is the user's — never share it, log it, or store it beyond the session unless the user explicitly asks.

---

## Managing API Keys

Users manage keys at **ubtrippin.xyz/settings**. Each key has a name and a masked preview. If a key is compromised, the user can revoke it from the settings page and generate a new one.
