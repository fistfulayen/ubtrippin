# PRD 019 — User Documentation Help Center

## What to Build

A `/help` page inside the dashboard that serves as the user documentation. Single page, well-organized with anchor links, clean design matching the app's white + indigo/slate aesthetic.

### Structure

Create `src/app/(dashboard)/help/page.tsx` as a server component. Content is static MDX or inline JSX — no CMS needed.

### Sections to include:

1. **Getting Started**
   - Forward bookings to trips@ubtrippin.xyz
   - Supported types: flights, trains, hotels, cars, restaurants, activities
   - How extraction works (usually <30 seconds)
   - What to do if extraction misses something

2. **Managing Trips**
   - Auto-created and AI-named trips
   - Edit trip details, dates, cover images
   - Add items manually
   - Delete items or trips
   - Merge trips

3. **Sharing & Collaboration**
   - Share via link (public share page)
   - Invite collaborators
   - What collaborators can see/do

4. **Calendar Sync**
   - Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook instructions
   - Refresh frequency
   - What shows in events

5. **Loyalty Programs**
   - Adding frequent flyer numbers
   - Encrypted storage

6. **City Guides**
   - Creating guides for your favorite cities
   - Adding places
   - Sharing guides
   - Map view

7. **Family Sharing**
   - Creating a family
   - Inviting members
   - What gets shared

8. **For Developers & Agents**
   - REST API overview (link to docs/API.md on GitHub)
   - MCP server
   - OpenClaw skill
   - Webhook notifications

9. **Billing & Pro**
   - What's free vs Pro
   - Early adopter pricing
   - Managing subscription

10. **FAQ**
    - "What if I forward the wrong email?"
    - "Can I use it for work travel?"
    - "Is my data private?"
    - "How do I delete my account?"

### Design Requirements

- Clean white background, `slate-800` text, `indigo-600` accent for links/headers
- Sticky sidebar navigation on desktop (anchor links to each section)
- Collapsible sections on mobile
- Search bar at top (client-side filter)
- Each section has an `id` for deep linking (`/help#calendar`)
- Add "Help" link in the dashboard sidebar navigation (question mark icon)
- Responsive — works on mobile

### Tech Stack
- Next.js 16 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, pnpm
- Content is inline JSX (not fetched from DB)
- Client components only for: search bar, mobile collapsible sections
- Do NOT use createSecretClient(). No DB access needed — this is static content.

### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/app/(dashboard)/help/page.tsx` — main help page
- `src/app/(dashboard)/help/help-search.tsx` — client component for search
- `src/app/(dashboard)/help/help-sidebar.tsx` — client component for nav
- `src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx` or equivalent — add Help link
- Update any existing nav components to include Help

### Quality
- `npx tsc --noEmit` must pass
- `pnpm build` must compile
- No `any` types
- Content must be accurate to current features
